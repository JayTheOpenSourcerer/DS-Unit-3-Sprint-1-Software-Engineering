What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

I think the most important part of code reviews is the ability to learn from and teach others.  Its the interaction.  I think that code reviews are great because it helps people be able to bounce their logic and blockers off a person rather than a rubber duck and get feedback. It also allows for communication of clean and proper code.  In addition you can use it as a bench mark as to perhaps where you should add comments to show your logic and thought process. So, really its the ability to colaborate that makes code reviews so important: Learning, Teaching, and Interacting.

We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?

Containers and the systems that run them like docker are logical solutions for this problem.  In order to get software to run from one development environment to another you need a system that helps to standardize the models.  The container allows a reproducible environment among all computers and allows developers and users alike to have the same experience with a program.
